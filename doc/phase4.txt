I renamed the existing phases, we now have:
1. Create pools
2. Select drivers and create parties
3. Rebalance driving distribution
5. Fill parties with passengers

Add a new phase 4 after phase 3 in algorithm_service.py:

Goal: Fair distribution of drive-counts and fewer overcrowded parties

- Use all members with fewer than 4 driving days to create additional parties
- For each member with fewer than 4 driving days:
    - Find the days on which the member is not driving
    - Cross-reference this with pools that are at high capacity (available seats equal to / close to required seats to accommodate remaining members)
    - Create the additional two parties for the member on that day (schoolbound + homebound)
    - If there are no days on which the member can "help" in this way, issue an INFO text like "Lina (Li) has only 3 drives but there are no days on which she can help reduce the pressure from packed parties"
