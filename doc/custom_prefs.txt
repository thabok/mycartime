The following frontend logic is needed for custom day prefs:

- Needs Car (needsCar) -> mutually exclusive with the option "No car" (drivingSkip)
- Skip AM (skipMorning) -> when activated, implicitly activates "Needs Car" as well (but doesn't deactivate it)
- Skip PM (skipAfternoon) -> when activated, implicitly activates "Needs Car" as well (but doesn't deactivate it)
- No wait PM (noWaitingAfternoon) -> mutually exclusive with "Skip PM"

The following backend logic is needed for custom day prefs (algorithm_service):

- Skip (ignoreCompletely)
    - The person shall not appear in the driving plan for that particular day
    - They shall neither be considered as a driver nor as a passenger
    - Validation after plan has been created: person is not part of any party of that day's day plan

- Needs Car (needsCar):
    - Perform validation: mutually exclusive with "no car" (drivingSkip)
    - The person shall be considered a mandatory driver for the day
    - The person must not be considered as a passenger on that day
    - Validation after plan has been created: person is one of the day's drivers

- Skip AM (skipMorning):
    - Perform validation: needsCar must also be true
    - The person shall be considered a mandatory driver for the day 
    - The schoolbound party shall have a flag that indicates that it's a "lonely driver" party
    - The algorithm shall ensure that no passengers are assigned to that person's schoolbound party
    - Validation after plan has been created: the person's schoolbound party must have 0 passengers

- Skip PM (skipAfternoon):
    - Perform validation: needsCar must also be true
    - The person shall be considered a mandatory driver for the day 
    - The homebound party shall have a flag that indicates that it's a "lonely driver" party
    - The algorithm shall ensure that no passengers are assigned to that person's homebound party
    - Validation after plan has been created: the person's homebound party must have 0 passengers

- No Wait PM (noWaitingAfternoon):
    - Perform validation: mutually exclusive with Skip PM
    - 0 minutes tolerance for homebound parties with this person:
        - If the person is selected as a driver for that day, the algorithm shall ensure zero tolerance (Tolerance: 0 minutes) when passengers are added to their homebound party
        - When considering the person as a passenger, also overwrite the default tolerance to 0 minutes for homebound parties
    - Validation after plan has been created: the person's end time (custom end or from schedule, of no custom end is defined) must exactly match the homebound party's time
